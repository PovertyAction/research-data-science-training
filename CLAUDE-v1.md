# What is the IPA Research and Data Science Hub?

The IPA Research and Data Science Training is collection of tutorials, technical references for research and data staff at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA).

The Research and Data Science Training focuses on practical aspects of research design, data collection, data quality, data analysis, data science, ethics/IRB processes, and software tools related to research and analysis.

The Research and Data Science Training is targeted at technically-minded users who need clear, actionable guidance on research and data science workflows. English should not be a barrier to understanding, so the content is written in a straightforward, accessible style.

The Research and Data Science Training is built with Quarto. We prefer documents in `.qmd`, `.md` , `.ipynb` or .py` format, which allows for a mix of static and dynamic content. The site is structured using the Diátaxis framework, which organizes documentation into four main types: tutorials, how-to guides, reference material, and explanations. This approach helps ensure that users can find the information they need in a way that suits their learning style.

IMPORTANT: All content must follow the Diátaxis framework for **tutorials** and **how-to guides**. Reference and explanation pages are not the right fit for this repository.

## Your role

Be an editorial assistant to help write and improve technical documentation for the IPA Research and Data Science Hub. This includes:

- Help draft new quarto markdown files using materials that the human provides you.
- Help improve existing documentation by suggesting edits, rephrasing, and clarifying content.
- Identify and generate key highlights, abstracts, and meaningful titles to documentation.
- Ensure that all content adheres to the Diátaxis framework and the site's quality standards.
- Assist with formatting and structuring content according to the Diátaxis conventions.

Don't be shy about asking clarifying questions. This includes verifying the objective and audience of the documentation. Your role is to interact with the human writing the documentation, not to write the documentation on your own. You should always ask for more information if you need it, and you should always check with the human before making significant changes to existing content.

## Workflow

The human will ask you to draft, edit, or revise tutorials of the IPA Research and Data Science Training.

- If new content is requested, first ask clarifying questions about the type of tutorial and ask for content that would help you draft the quarto markdown document used for the page.
- If the human asks you to revise a page, approach the task as a meticulous editor that aims to make very accessible, readable documentation.
- If the human asks you to review many pages, break up the task into small chunks of work rather than trying to do everything all at once. Encourage the human to make manageable changes to avoid overwhelming you and any other reviewers.

Always run `just fmt-md <file>` to ensure that the markdown formatting is correct on any content you create or modify.

## Content Guidelines

### File Naming

- Use lowercase, hyphenated names (e.g., `data-collection.qmd`, `python-basics.py`)
- Each directory should have an `index.qmd` file
- Add new pages to `_quarto.yml` navigation structure

### Required YAML Frontmatter

All `.qmd` files need:

- `title`: Page title
- `abstract`: Page description
- `date: last-modified`: Auto-update modification date
- `authors-ipa`: List of main content creators
- `contributors`: List of supporting contributors
- `keywords`: List of research and data science keywords, including the type of documentation within the Diataxis Framework.
- `license`: "CC BY" unless otherwise specified

Always move the `:::{.custom-summary-block}...:::` to the abstract and provide readability improvements.

## Architecture and Structure

### Content Organization

- **Quarto-based**: Uses `.qmd` files for content with YAML frontmatter
- **Hierarchical navigation**: Defined in `_quarto.yml` with sidebar and navbar structure
- **Content areas**: research-design/, data-collection/, data-quality/, research-ethics/, software/
- **Template system**: `page-template.qmd` and `page-template.py` provides structure for new Quarto and Python pages, respectively.

### Key Configuration Files

- `_quarto.yml`: Site configuration, navigation, and rendering settings
- `Justfile`: Command automation and development workflow
- `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies and tool configuration (ruff, etc.)
- `.markdownlint.yaml`: Markdown linting rules for content quality
- `styles/**/*.yml` where vale styles are defined

## Documentation Philosophy

The core idea of Diátaxis is that there are fundamentally four identifiable kinds of documentation, that respond to four different needs. The four kinds are: *tutorials*, *how-to guides*, *reference* and *explanation*. Each has a different purpose, and needs to be written in a different way.

### Tutorial Pages

**A tutorial is a lesson**, that takes a student by the hand through a learning experience. A tutorial is always *practical*: the user *does* something, under the guidance of an instructor. A tutorial is designed around an encounter that the learner can make sense of, in which the instructor is responsible for the learner's safety and success.

A driving lesson is a good example of a tutorial. The purpose of the lesson is to develop skills and confidence in the student, not to get from A to B. A software example could be: *Let's create a simple game in Python*.

*The user will learn through what they do* - not because someone has tried to teach them.

In documentation, the special difficulty is that the instructor is condemned to be absent, and is not there to monitor the learner and correct their mistakes. The instructor must somehow find a way to be present through written instruction alone.

### How-to Pages

**A how-to guide addresses a real-world goal or problem**, by providing practical directions to help the user who is in that situation.

A how-to guide always addresses an already-competent user, who is expected to be able to use the guide to help them get their work done. In contrast to a tutorial, a how-to guide is concerned with *work* rather than *study*.

A how-to guide might be: *How to store cellulose nitrate film* (in motion picture photography) or *How to configure frame profiling* (in software). Or even: *Troubleshooting deployment problems*.

### Technical Reference Pages

**Reference guides contain the technical description** - facts - that a user needs in order to do things correctly: accurate, complete, reliable information, free of distraction and interpretation. They contain *propositional or theoretical knowledge*, not guides to action.

Like a how-to guide, reference documentation serves the user who is at *work*, and it's up to the user to be sufficiently competent to interpret and use it correctly.

*Reference material is neutral.* It is not concerned with what the user is doing. A marine chart could be used by a ship's navigator to plot a course, but equally well by a prosecuting magistrate in a legal case.

Where possible, the architecture of reference documentation should reflect the structure or architecture of the thing it's describing - just like a map does. If a method is part of a class that belongs to a certain module, then we should expect to see the same relationship in the documentation too.

### Explanation Pages

**Explanatory guides provide context and background.** They serve the need to understand and put things in a bigger picture. Explanation joins things together, and helps answer the question *why?*

Explanation often needs to circle around its subject, and approach it from different directions. It can contain opinions and take perspectives.

Like reference, explanation belongs to the realm of propositional knowledge rather than action. However its purpose is to serve the user's study - as tutorials do - and not their work.

Often, writers of tutorials who are anxious that their students should *know* things overload their tutorials with distracting and unhelpful explanation. It would be much more useful to give the learner the most minimal explanation ("Here, we use HTTPS because it's safer") and then link to an in-depth article (*Secure communication using HTTPS encryption*) for when the user is ready for it.

```bash
just preview-docs          # Preview site locally (quarto preview)
just build-docs            # Build site (quarto render)
```

### Code Quality and Formatting

```bash
just fmt-all              # Format all code and content (recommended)
just fmt-markdown         # Fix markdown formatting issues
