## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Identify the main areas of the Positron interface
- Understand the purpose of each panel and view
- Navigate between different workspaces and layouts
- Customize the interface for your workflow
- Use key keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation

## The Positron Interface Layout

When you first open Positron, you'll see an interface that looks familiar if you've used VS Code, but with important additions for data science work.

### Main Interface Areas

The Positron interface consists of five main areas:

1. **Menu Bar** (top): File, Edit, View, etc.
2. **Activity Bar** (left side): Main navigation icons
3. **Side Bar** (left panel): Context-sensitive content
4. **Editor Group** (center): Where you write and view code
5. **Panel** (bottom): Console, terminal, and other tools

::: {.callout-note}
Unlike VS Code, Positron includes specialized panels for data science work, including the Console, Variables, and Plots panels.
:::

## Step 1: Explore the Activity Bar

The Activity Bar on the left contains icons for different views. Let's explore each one:

1. **Explorer**: File and folder navigation
   - Click the Explorer icon (top icon)
   - This shows your workspace files and folders
   - Similar to VS Code's Explorer

2. **Search**: Search across files
   - Click the Search icon
   - Search for text across your entire workspace

3. **Source Control**: Git integration
   - Click the Source Control icon
   - Manage version control (we'll cover this in later tutorials)

4. **Run and Debug**: Execute and debug code
   - Click the Run and Debug icon
   - Set breakpoints and debug your code

5. **Extensions**: Manage extensions
   - Click the Extensions icon
   - Install and manage Positron extensions

## Step 2: Understanding the Console Panel

The Console is one of Positron's most important features for data science work:

1. **Open the Console**:
   - Look at the bottom panel
   - You should see a "Console" tab
   - If not visible, go to `View > Console` or press `Ctrl+Shift+`` (backtick)

2. **Console Features**:
   - Interactive Python/R console
   - Command history (use ↑ and ↓ arrows)
   - Auto-completion support
   - Direct execution of selected code

3. **Try the Console**:
   - Type `2 + 2` and press Enter
   - You should see the result displayed

::: {.callout-tip}
The Console remembers your command history. Use the up arrow to access previous commands.
:::

## Step 3: Explore Data Science Panels

Positron includes several panels specifically designed for data science:

### Variables Panel

1. **Access the Variables Panel**:
   - Look for the Variables tab in the bottom panel
   - If not visible: `View > Variables`

2. **What it shows**:
   - Current variables in your environment
   - Variable types and values
   - Memory usage information

### Plots Panel

1. **Access the Plots Panel**:
   - Look for the Plots tab in the bottom panel
   - If not visible: `View > Plots`

2. **What it shows**:
   - Visualizations you create
   - Plot history and navigation
   - Export options for plots

### Help Panel

1. **Access the Help Panel**:
   - Look for the Help tab in the side panel
   - Provides context-sensitive documentation

## Step 4: Working with the Editor

The Editor is where you'll spend most of your time writing code:

1. **Create a New File**:
   - Press `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (macOS)
   - Or use `File > New File`

2. **File Types**:
   - `.py` files for Python
   - `.R` files for R
   - `.ipynb` files for Jupyter notebooks
   - `.qmd` files for Quarto documents

3. **Editor Features**:
   - Syntax highlighting
   - Auto-completion (`Ctrl+Space`)
   - Code formatting
   - Integrated terminal

## Step 5: Customize Your Workspace

Let's personalize Positron for your workflow:

### Themes and Appearance

1. **Change Theme**:
   - Go to `File > Preferences > Theme > Color Theme`
   - Choose from Light, Dark, or High Contrast themes

2. **Font Size**:
   - Go to `File > Preferences > Settings`
   - Search for "font size"
   - Adjust to your preference

### Panel Layout

1. **Move Panels**:
   - Right-click on any panel tab
   - Choose "Move Panel Right/Left/Up/Down"

2. **Hide/Show Panels**:
   - Use the `View` menu to toggle panels
   - Or use keyboard shortcuts (shown in menus)

## Step 6: Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn these shortcuts to work more efficiently:

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Command Palette | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | `Cmd+Shift+P` |
| Quick File Open | `Ctrl+P` | `Cmd+P` |
| Toggle Console | `Ctrl+Shift+`` | `Cmd+Shift+`` |
| New File | `Ctrl+N` | `Cmd+N` |
| Save File | `Ctrl+S` | `Cmd+S` |
| Find in File | `Ctrl+F` | `Cmd+F` |
| Run Selection | `F9` | `F9` |

::: {.callout-tip}
Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the Command Palette and access any Positron feature by typing its name.
:::

## Step 7: Practice Navigation

Let's practice using the interface:

1. **Create a Practice File**:
   - Press `Ctrl+N` to create a new file
   - Save it as `practice.py` (`Ctrl+S`)

2. **Write Some Code**:

   ```python
   # This is a practice file
   x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   print(f"My list has {len(x)} items")
   ```

3. **Run the Code**:
   - Select the code lines
   - Press `F9` to run in the Console

4. **Check the Variables Panel**:
   - Look at the Variables panel
   - You should see the variable `x` listed

## What's Different from VS Code?

If you're familiar with VS Code, here are key differences in Positron:

| Feature | VS Code | Positron |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Console | Terminal only | Interactive Python/R console |
| Variables | Extensions needed | Built-in Variables panel |
| Plots | Extensions needed | Built-in Plots panel |
| Data Science | Requires setup | Optimized out-of-the-box |
| Help | External docs | Integrated Help panel |
