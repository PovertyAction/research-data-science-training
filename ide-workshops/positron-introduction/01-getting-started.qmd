## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Download and install Positron on your operating system
- Launch Positron for the first time
- Understand the system requirements
- Verify your installation is working correctly

## What is Positron?

Positron is a next-generation data science IDE built by Posit PBC. It's designed specifically for Python and R users who want:

- Interactive data science tools
- Enhanced notebook support
- AI integrations for coding assistance
- A familiar VS Code-based interface with data science enhancements

::: {.callout-note}
Positron is built on Code OSS (the open-source foundation of Visual Studio Code), so if you're familiar with VS Code, you'll feel at home in Positron.
:::

## System Requirements

Before installing Positron, ensure your system meets these minimum requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 8+)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Disk Space**: 500MB for installation
- **Internet Connection**: Required for initial setup and extensions

## Step 1: Download Positron

1. Go to the [Positron download page](https://positron.posit.co/)
2. Click the **Download** button for your operating system
3. The download will begin automatically

::: {.callout-tip}
Positron is currently in beta, so expect regular updates. Check back periodically for new versions.

## Step 2: Install Positron

### Windows Installation

1. Locate the downloaded `.exe` file (usually in your Downloads folder)
2. Double-click the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard:
   - Accept the license agreement
   - Choose installation directory (default is recommended)
   - Select additional tasks (creating desktop shortcut is recommended)
4. Click **Install**
5. Launch Positron when installation completes

### macOS Installation

1. Locate the downloaded `.dmg` file
2. Double-click to mount the disk image
3. Drag the Positron application to your Applications folder
4. Launch Positron from Applications or Launchpad

::: {.callout-warning}
On macOS, you may see a security warning about the app being from an unidentified developer. Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass this warning.
:::

### Linux Installation

For Ubuntu/Debian systems:

1. Download the `.deb` package
2. Install using: `sudo dpkg -i positron-*.deb`
3. If dependencies are missing, run: `sudo apt-get install -f`

For RPM-based systems (CentOS, Fedora):

1. Download the `.rpm` package
2. Install using: `sudo rpm -i positron-*.rpm`

## Step 3: First Launch

1. Launch Positron from your applications menu or desktop shortcut
2. On first startup, Positron will:
   - Check for system compatibility
   - Set up the workspace
   - Display the welcome screen

::: {.callout-note}
The first launch may take a few moments as Positron initializes its components.
:::

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Let's verify that Positron is working correctly:

1. **Check the Interface**: You should see the Positron interface with:
   - Menu bar at the top
   - Activity bar on the left side
   - Editor area in the center
   - Status bar at the bottom

2. **Open the Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)
   - Type "Positron" - you should see Positron-specific commands

3. **Check the Console**:
   - Look for the Console panel at the bottom
   - This is where Python and R output will appear

## What's Next?

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Positron. In the next tutorial, you will:

- Explore the Positron interface
- Learn about the different panels and their purposes
- Understand how Positron differs from VS Code

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

- **Insufficient permissions**: Run the installer as administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (Linux)
- **Antivirus interference**: Temporarily disable antivirus during installation
- **Outdated system**: Ensure your operating system meets minimum requirements
