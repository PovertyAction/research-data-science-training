## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Install and configure Python and R interpreters
- Switch between different interpreter versions
- Create and manage Python virtual environments
- Install packages for data science work
- Verify your interpreter setup is working correctly

## Understanding Interpreters in Positron

An interpreter is the program that executes your code. Positron supports both Python and R interpreters, allowing you to work in either language (or both!) depending on your project needs.

::: {.callout-note}
You can have multiple interpreters installed and switch between them as needed. This is especially useful when working on different projects with different requirements.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before setting up interpreters, ensure you have completed the previous tutorials:

- Positron installation and setup
- Basic interface navigation

## Part 1: Python Interpreter Setup

### Step 1: Check for Existing Python Installation

First, let's see if Python is already available:

1. **Open the Console** in Positron (`Ctrl+Shift+`` )
2. **Check Python Availability**:
   - Look at the console - it may already show a Python interpreter
   - If you see `>>>` prompt, Python is ready
   - If not, we'll set it up

### Step 2: Install Python (if needed)

If you don't have Python installed:

**Option A: Using `uv` (Recommended)**

1. Open a terminal
2. Install `uv`:

   ```bash
   # On Windows (using winget)
   winget install --id astral-sh.uv

   # On macOS/Linux (using Homebrew)
   brew install uv
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation

**Option B: Using Python.org**

1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download the latest Python 3.x version
3. Run the installer
4. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Step 3: Configure Python in Positron

1. **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. **Choose from the list**:
   - Positron will show available Python installations
   - Select the version you want to use
   - Look for versions like "Python 3.11.x" or "Python 3.10.x"

4. **Verify Setup**:
   - Open the Console
   - Type `python --version`
   - You should see your Python version displayed

::: {.callout-tip}
If you don't see "Python: Select Interpreter" in the Command Palette, try typing "Positron: Select Python Interpreter" instead.
:::

### Step 4: Test Python Setup

Let's verify Python is working correctly:

1. **In the Console**, type:

   ```python
   print("Hello from Python!")
   import sys
   print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
   ```

2. **Expected Output**:

   ```
   Hello from Python!
   Python version: 3.11.x (main, ...)
   ```

## Part 2: R Interpreter Setup

### Step 1: Install R

If you don't have R installed:

1. **Go to CRAN**: [r-project.org](https://r-project.org)
2. **Choose your platform**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
3. **Download and install** the latest R version
4. **Follow the installation wizard** with default settings

### Step 2: Configure R in Positron

1. **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: "R: Select Interpreter" or "Positron: Select R Interpreter"
3. **Choose your R installation**:
   - Positron will detect R installations
   - Select the version you installed

4. **Switch to R Console**:
   - Look for console selection dropdown (usually near the console)
   - Choose "R" instead of "Python"

### Step 3: Test R Setup

Let's verify R is working:

1. **In the R Console**, type:

   ```r
   print("Hello from R!")
   R.version.string
   ```

2. **Expected Output**:

   ```
   [1] "Hello from R!"
   [1] "R version 4.3.x (2024-xx-xx)"
   ```

## Part 3: Managing Python Virtual Environments

Virtual environments help keep your projects isolated and organized.

### Create a Virtual Environment

1. **Open Terminal** in Positron: `View > Terminal`

2. **Create Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Using venv (built into Python)
   python -m venv myproject_env

   # Or using conda (if you have Anaconda)
   conda create -n myproject_env python=3.11
   ```

3. **Activate Environment**:

   **Windows**:

   ```bash
   myproject_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **macOS/Linux**:

   ```bash
   source myproject_env/bin/activate
   ```

   **Conda** (all platforms):

   ```bash
   conda activate myproject_env
   ```

### Select Virtual Environment in Positron

1. **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type**: "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. **Choose your virtual environment** from the list
4. **Verify**: Look at the status bar - it should show your environment name

## Part 4: Installing Essential Packages

Let's install common data science packages:

### For Python

With your virtual environment activated:

```bash
# Essential data science packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

# Additional useful packages
pip install scikit-learn plotly requests
```

### For R

In the R Console:

```r
# Essential packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))

# Additional useful packages
install.packages(c("plotly", "DT", "knitr"))
```

::: {.callout-warning}
Package installation may take several minutes, especially for data science packages with many dependencies.
:::

## Part 5: Switching Between Languages

Positron makes it easy to switch between Python and R:

### Method 1: Console Selector

- Look for a dropdown near the Console
- Click it to switch between "Python" and "R"

### Method 2: Command Palette

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Type "Console" and look for language-specific options
- Select "Python Console" or "R Console"

### Method 3: File Association

- `.py` files automatically use Python
- `.R` files automatically use R
- Create files with appropriate extensions

## Step 6: Verify Complete Setup

Let's test both interpreters with a data science example:

### Python Test

Create a new file `test_python.py`:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.arange(10),
    'y': np.random.rand(10)
})

print("Python setup working!")
print(data.head())
```

Select the code and press `F9` to run.

### R Test

Create a new file `test_r.R`:

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Create sample data
data <- data.frame(
  x = 1:10,
  y = runif(10)
)

print("R setup working!")
print(head(data))
```

Select the code and press `F9` to run.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Python Issues

**"Python not found"**:

- Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH
- Restart Positron after installation
- Use Command Palette to select interpreter

**Package installation fails**:

- Check internet connection
- Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Use virtual environments to avoid conflicts

### R Issues

**"R not found"**:

- Ensure R is properly installed
- Check that R is in your system PATH
- Restart Positron after R installation

**Package installation fails**:

- Check CRAN mirror in R: `chooseCRANmirror()`
- Try installing one package at a time
- Check for permission issues
