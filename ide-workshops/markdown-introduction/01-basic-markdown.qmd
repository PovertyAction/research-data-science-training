## Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown uses simple symbols to format text. Let's start with the most common elements you'll use in every document.

## Headings

Create headings using hash symbols (`#`). The number of hashes determines the heading level:

```markdown
## Heading 2 (second largest)
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6 (smallest)
```

**Result:**

## Heading 2 (second largest)

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6 (smallest)

::: {.callout-tip}

## Heading Best Practices

- Use only one H1 heading per document (usually the title)
- Don't skip heading levels (don't jump from H2 to H4)
- Keep headings descriptive and concise
:::

## Text Emphasis

Make text bold or italic using asterisks or underscores:

```markdown
*italic text* or _italic text_
**bold text** or __bold text__
***bold and italic*** or ___bold and italic___
```

**Result:**

*italic text* or *italic text*

**bold text** or **bold text**

***bold and italic*** or ***bold and italic***

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks

- Separate paragraphs with a blank line
- For a line break within a paragraph, end the line with two spaces

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.

This line ends with two spaces
So this appears on a new line but in the same paragraph.
```

**Result:**

This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.

This line ends with two spaces
So this appears on a new line but in the same paragraph.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Create bullet lists using `-`, `*`, or `+`:

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B
```

**Result:**

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B

### Ordered Lists

Create numbered lists using numbers followed by periods:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. Sub-item A
   2. Sub-item B
```

**Result:**

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. Sub-item A
   2. Sub-item B

## Links

Create links using square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL:

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
[Link with title](https://example.com "This appears on hover")
```

**Result:**

[Link text](https://example.com)

[Link with title](https://example.com "This appears on hover")

### Reference Links

For cleaner documents, use reference-style links:

```markdown
Check out [Google][google-link] and [GitHub][github-link].

[google-link]: https://google.com
[github-link]: https://github.com
```

**Result:**

Check out [Google][google-link] and [GitHub][github-link].

[google-link]: https://google.com
[github-link]: https://github.com

## Images

Images use similar syntax to links, but with an exclamation mark at the beginning:

```markdown
![Alt text](image-url.jpg)
![Alt text with title](image-url.jpg "Image title")
```

For local images:

```markdown
![Research diagram](../images/research-flow.png)
```

## Code

### Inline Code

Wrap text in backticks for inline code:

```markdown
Use the `print()` function to display output.
```

**Result:**

Use the `print()` function to display output.

### Code Blocks

Use three backticks for code blocks:

````markdown
```
This is a code block
Multiple lines are preserved
Indentation is maintained
```
````

**Result:**

```text
This is a code block
Multiple lines are preserved
Indentation is maintained
```

## Blockquotes

Create blockquotes using the `>` symbol:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
>
> And multiple paragraphs.
```

**Result:**

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
>
> And multiple paragraphs.

## Horizontal Rules

Create horizontal lines using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---
***
___
```

**Result:**

---

## Practice Exercise

Now it's your turn! Try creating a document that includes:

1. A main heading
2. At least two subheadings
3. Some **bold** and *italic* text
4. A bulleted list with at least 3 items
5. A numbered list
6. At least one link
7. A blockquote
8. Some `inline code`

## Your First Markdown Document

Start with a simple document about yourself or your research interests. Practice using different elements as you write naturally.
