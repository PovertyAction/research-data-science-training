## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 as a way to write content that could be easily converted to HTML while remaining readable in its raw form.

## Why Learn Markdown?

Markdown has become the standard for technical documentation, README files, and content creation because:

- **Simple syntax**: Easy to learn and remember
- **Platform independent**: Works everywhere, from GitHub to documentation sites
- **Future-proof**: Plain text files that will always be readable
- **Version control friendly**: Perfect for tracking changes in Git
- **Widely supported**: Used by GitHub, GitLab, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and many more

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial series will take you through three levels of Markdown mastery:

### 1. Basic Markdown

Learn the core syntax that works everywhere Markdown is supported, including headings, emphasis, lists, links, and images.

### 2. GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)

Discover the extensions that GitHub adds to Markdown, including tables, task lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and more.

### 3. Quarto Markdown

Explore how Quarto extends Markdown for scientific and technical publishing, with features like cross-references, citations, callout blocks, and executable code.
