## Prerequisites and Setup

Before we begin, ensure your system meets the basic requirements for running VS Code.

### System Requirements

Visual Studio Code is lightweight and runs on most modern systems:

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or 11
- **macOS**: macOS 10.14 or later
- **Linux**: Most distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, etc.)

## Step 1: Download and Install VS Code

### Download VS Code

1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Click the download button for your operating system
3. The website will automatically detect your OS and suggest the appropriate version

### Installation Instructions

#### Windows

1. Run the downloaded `.exe` installer
2. Follow the setup wizard
3. Accept the license agreement
4. Choose installation location (default is recommended)
5. Select additional tasks:
   - ✅ Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file context menu
   - ✅ Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer directory context menu
   - ✅ Register Code as an editor for supported file types
   - ✅ Add to PATH (this allows you to type `code` in the command line)

#### macOS

1. Open the downloaded `.zip` file
2. Drag the Visual Studio Code app to the Applications folder
3. Launch VS Code from the Applications folder or Spotlight

#### Linux

For Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
# Download the .deb package and install
sudo dpkg -i code_*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Install dependencies if needed
```

## Step 2: Launch VS Code

After installation, launch VS Code:

- **Windows**: Start menu → Visual Studio Code
- **macOS**: Applications → Visual Studio Code
- **Linux**: Applications menu → Visual Studio Code
- **Any OS**: Type `code` in terminal (if added to PATH)

## Step 3: Understanding the Interface

When you first open VS Code, you'll see the Welcome tab and basic interface elements:

### Main Interface Components

1. **Activity Bar** (far left): Access different views
   - Explorer: File and folder navigation
   - Search: Find and replace across files
   - Source Control: Git integration
   - Run and Debug: Debug your code
   - Extensions: Install and manage extensions

2. **Side Bar**: Shows different views based on Activity Bar selection

3. **Editor**: Main area where you write and edit code

4. **Panel** (bottom): Integrated terminal, output, problems, and debug console

5. **Status Bar** (bottom): Information about current file and project

## Step 4: Open Your First Workspace

A workspace in VS Code is simply a folder containing your project files.

### Method 1: Open Folder

1. Click **File** → **Open Folder** (Windows/Linux) or **Open...** (macOS)
2. Navigate to a folder you want to work with
3. Click **Select Folder** (Windows/Linux) or **Open** (macOS)

### Method 2: Create New Folder

1. Create a new folder on your system (e.g., `my-first-project`)
2. Open this folder in VS Code using Method 1

### Method 3: Command Line

If you added VS Code to PATH during installation:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

# Open current directory in VS Code
code .

# Or open a specific folder
code /path/to/folder
```

## Step 5: Workspace Trust

VS Code includes security features to protect you from potentially malicious code.

### Understanding Workspace Trust

When you open a folder, VS Code may show a "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?" dialog.

- **Trust**: Enables all VS Code features, extensions, and tasks
- **Don't Trust**: Opens in Restricted Mode with limited functionality

### Making Trust Decisions

::: {.callout-warning}

## Security Consideration

Only trust workspaces from sources you trust. When in doubt, choose "Don't Trust" and enable trust later if needed.
:::

**Trust when:**

- You created the files yourself
- Files are from a trusted colleague or organization
- You understand the code and its purpose

**Don't trust when:**

- Files are from unknown sources
- Downloaded from the internet without verification
- Contains code you don't understand

### Managing Trust Later

You can change trust settings later:

- Click the workspace trust icon in the Status Bar
- Or use Command Palette: **Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust**

## Step 6: Create Your First File

Let's create a simple file to explore VS Code's features:

1. In the Explorer (Activity Bar → Explorer), right-click in the empty space
2. Select **New File**
3. Name it `hello.txt`
4. Type some text: "Hello, VS Code!"
5. Save with **Ctrl+S** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+S** (macOS)

## Step 7: Basic Configuration

Let's configure a few essential settings:

### Enable Auto Save

1. Go to **File** → **Preferences** → **Settings** (Windows/Linux)
   Or **Code** → **Preferences** → **Settings** (macOS)
2. Search for "auto save"
3. Set **Files: Auto Save** to "afterDelay"
4. Set **Files: Auto Save Delay** to 1000 (milliseconds)

### Adjust Font Size

1. In Settings, search for "font size"
2. Adjust **Editor: Font Size** to your preference (default is 14)

### Choose a Theme

1. **File** → **Preferences** → **Color Theme**
2. Use arrow keys to preview different themes
3. Press Enter to select

## Understanding Settings

VS Code has two types of settings:

### User Settings

- Apply globally to all VS Code instances
- Stored in your user profile

### Workspace Settings

- Apply only to the current workspace
- Stored in `.vscode/settings.json` in the workspace folder
- Override user settings

::: {.callout-note}

## Exercise: Explore the Interface

Take a few minutes to:

1. Click on each Activity Bar icon to see different views
2. Open the integrated terminal (**View** → **Terminal**)
3. Try the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P** / **Cmd+Shift+P**)
4. Create a new file and notice the unsaved changes indicator

## Next Steps

Now that you have VS Code installed and configured, you're ready to explore its features! In the next tutorial, we'll dive into the [Basic Features](02-basics.qmd) with video walkthroughs of core functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### Windows: "Windows protected your PC" warning

- Click "More info" then "Run anyway"
- This is normal for new software

#### macOS: "Cannot verify developer" error

- Right-click the app and select "Open"
- Click "Open" in the dialog

#### Linux: Permission denied

- Make sure you have admin privileges
- Use `sudo` with installation commands
