## Learning Objectives

- Use `grep` to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.
- Use `find` to find files and directories whose names match simple patterns.
- Use the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command.
- Explain what is meant by 'text' and 'binary' files, and why many common tools don't handle the latter well.

## Questions

- How can I find files?
- How can I find things in files?
:::

In the same way that many of us now use "Google" as a
verb meaning "to find", Unix programmers often use the
word "grep".
"grep" is a contraction of "global/regular expression/print",
a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.
It is also the name of a very useful command-line program.

`grep` finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.
For our examples,
we will use a file that contains three haikus taken from a
1998 competition in *Salon* magazine. For this set of examples,
we're going to be working in the writing subdirectory:

```bash
cd
cd Desktop/data/exercise-data/writing
cat haiku.txt
```

```output
The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
```

## Using `grep`

Let's find lines that contain the word "not":

```bash
grep not haiku.txt
```

```output
Is not the true Tao, until
"My Thesis" not found.
Today it is not working
```

## Key Points

- `find` finds files with specific properties that match patterns.
- `grep` selects lines in files that match patterns.
- `--help` is an option supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within Bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs.
- `man [command]` displays the manual page for a given command.
- `$([command])` inserts a command's output in place.
