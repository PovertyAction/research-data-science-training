## Download files

You will need these two files:

1. Pre-populated SQLite database: [SQL\_SAFI.sqlite](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-socialsci/data/SQL_SAFI.sqlite)
2. SAFI Farms table as a CSV file: [SAFI\_farms.csv](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-socialsci/data/SAFI_farms.csv)

## Installing DB Browser for SQLite

There are different ways to install the DB Browser on your machine. The Firefox plugin has been discontinued and is no longer available.

1. The recommended approach is the install the standalone version of the DB Browser application from the [DB Browser main website](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
2. Choose the version appropriate to your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
3. Install the application by double clicking the downloaded file and following the installation procedures.

## Invoke the DB Browser application

1. If you installed the standalone application you can start it from the applications menu or by double clicking the application icon.
2. When you start the application, you will see a window appear like the one shown below.

## Install the SQLite Shell program

The SQLite shell can be downloaded from [here](https://sqlite.org/download.html). There are versions available for Linux, Mac and Windows. As I have a Windows machine I will download the Windows version. You should download the version appropriate to your machine. Note that MacOS already have sqlite installed so you can skip this section.

The number after the x86- may be different when you download if a later version has been released.
The download is a .zip file. You need to unzip the file and store the contents (3 files) in a folder of your choosing. There is no actual install process, the program (file) sqlite3.exe can be run directly from the folder.
You may however like to add the folder location to your PATH environment variable so that you can call sqlite3 from any command prompt.

## Invoke the SQLite Shell program

You invoke the SQLite Shell from the commandline. Remember that the program is sqlite3 and you must have added the folder name to your envirnment PATH or explicitly navigated to the folder before trying to run the program.

You do not need to specify any parameters, connection to a databse can be done from within the shell.

## Installing the SQLite ODBC connector

The SQLIte main site at [https://sqlite.org/](https://sqlite.org/) does not provide a download for an ODBC connector. A Google search will provide other sites that do. One freely available SQLite ODBC connector is available at [http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/](https://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/). You should download the sqliteodbc.exe file. The file is a self contained Windows installer which you can run by double clicking it. You will however need Admin rights on the machine to perform the install.

This is a 32bit ODBC connector so it is assumed that you are using a 32bit version of Excel. A 64bit version of the driver is available from the Werner site should you need it.

You can check that the driver has been successfully installed by typing ODBC into the Windows start search panel and then selecting 'ODBC DataSources (32 bit)'

At the bottom of the list in the 'system DSN' tab youshould see the entry for the 'SQlite3 datasource'.

## Key Points

- Both the DB Browser application and the SQLite tools can be directly downloaded from the Internet
- The DB Browser application is a standard windows program
- The sqlite3 program is run from the windows commandline
- You will need admin privileges to install the ODBC driver
