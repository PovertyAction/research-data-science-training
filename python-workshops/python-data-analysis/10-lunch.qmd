Over lunch, reflect on and discuss the following:

- What sort of packages might you use in Python and why would you use them?
- How would data need to be formatted to be used in Pandas data frames? Would the data you have meet these requirements?
- What limitations or problems might you run into when thinking about how to apply what we've learned to your own projects or data?
