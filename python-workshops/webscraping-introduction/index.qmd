## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites by parsing HTML content. It's a powerful technique for collecting structured data from web pages that don't provide APIs or downloadable datasets.

### When to Use Web Scraping

**Appropriate use cases**:

- Public data collection for research
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Academic research requiring web-based data
- News monitoring and content aggregation
- Price monitoring and comparison

**When to avoid web scraping**:

- When APIs are available (use APIs instead)
- For copyrighted or proprietary content
- When explicitly prohibited by terms of service
- For personal or private information

### Introduction to Gazpacho

Gazpacho is a lightweight Python library that simplifies web scraping by providing an intuitive interface for HTML parsing. It's designed to be easier than traditional tools like requests + BeautifulSoup while maintaining essential functionality.

**Why choose gazpacho?**

- Simplified syntax for common scraping tasks
- Built-in HTTP handling
- Lightweight and fast
- Pythonic API design
- Good documentation and community

## Ethical Web Scraping Guidelines

### Legal Considerations

- **Check robots.txt**: Always review `website.com/robots.txt`
- **Respect terms of service**: Read and follow website ToS
- **Public data only**: Focus on publicly available information
- **Attribution**: Credit data sources appropriately

### Technical Best Practices

- **Rate limiting**: Don't overwhelm servers with requests
- **User agents**: Identify your scraper appropriately
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handle failed requests
- **Caching**: Store results to minimize repeat requests

### Research Ethics

- **Data minimization**: Only collect data you need
- **Privacy protection**: Avoid personal information
- **Transparency**: Document your scraping methodology
- **Data security**: Protect collected data appropriately
